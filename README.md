# Hello-world
This is my first attempt at a git repository

Hi all,

Just getting back to learning linux after many years off.  Seems like with so many resources out there the process of learning will be easier.  

That said... I really don't know why eperts in stuff like programming make us new novices feel like idiots.  Alot that I read on Git could be easier if they just took the time to explain vs. assume you know what the heck they are talking about.  

Anyway thanks everyone who helps a novice! We do really appreciate it!
